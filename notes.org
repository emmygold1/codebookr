* Initially
- readCodeBook.R from dryworkflow which I believe is mid 2015

* Process (as documented previously)
just use devtools:: as outlined in Hadley Wickham's R packages book

eg devtools::load_all()
   devtools::document()
   devtools::build()
   devtools::check()

ess seems lacking w.r.t. package development although bindings etc
  available with
- ess-r-devtools-ask bound to C-c C-w C-a.
- ess-r-package-mode
- ess-r-set-evaluation-env bound by default to C-c C-t C-s
 or set ess-r-package-auto-set-evaluation-env to nil to disable this. 
- devtools packages and are accessible with C-c C-w prefix see documentation
  for ess-r-package-mode


* Codebook data

Column names for data dictionary (parameter column_names)

| Name              | Value in file    | Notes                     |
|-------------------+------------------+---------------------------|
| variable_name     | "Variable"       |                           |
| variable_label    | "Label"          |                           |
| variable_original | "Original_Name"  |                           |
| variable_levels   | "Levels"         | for factors               |
| variable_limits   | "Limits"         | for continuous variables  |
| min               | "Minimum"        | "   "           "         |
| max               | "Maximum"        | "   "           "         |
| missing_values    | "Missing_Values" | documented eg -9, .,  etc |
| factor_type       | "Factor_Type"    | factor, nominal, ordinal  |
| comments          | "Comments"       |                           |
|                   |                  |                           |

Note that 
- all column_names are unlikely to be present
- can override column names
- might be best to set up as options so that can be changed globally
  where necessary (.onLoad - see pp30 R Packages)

* ideas for other functions
- should I move from camel case to underscore and lower case
- remember can use structure() to make data frame with attribute in
  one hit
- I thought I had some of these in a previous incarnation of
  dryworkflow
** STARTED create_factors function
- maybe could be named addFactors or addFactorLevels or add_factors or
  create_factors
- could use 'forcats' more although readr probably sufficient
- what about 'purrr' or 'stringr'? Of any use?
- check values for factors maybe case change as well - easier to use
  readr::parse_factor()
** TODO validate_limits for continuous variables
- dplyr ? continuous variables ?
** TODO overall wrapper function to do all in one

NB: could change column_* to col_* and keep names a bit smaller

* S3 codebook object
Maybe should have several objects in list - not just codebook. How
about these as possibilities or should some be attributes?? NB: Can
always modify once I get working strategy
- data_dictionary (al. la. table above)
- version_data_dictionary ??
- hashsum_data_dictionary (for cross checking)
- data_management_plan (various details as list - can be empty of course)
    + version
    + date
    + description
    + url or location
    + authors 
    + just grab some examples and try and populate variours components
- data_managemnt_plan_hashsum ?
- shreadsheet_name  (attributes??)
- spreadsheet_column_names
- spreadsheet_hashsum
- log - list indexed by times?

Some of these things are really about version control - this would be
an attempt to make them self contained but VC better IMHO
