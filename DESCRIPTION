Authors@R: person("Peter", "Baker", email = "drpetebaker@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Automates cleaning, checking and formatting data using metadata
    from Codebooks or Data Dictionaries. It is primarily aimed at
    epidemiological research and medical studies but can be easily
    used in other research areas. Codebook metadata can be read into
    R and then used directly for data checking, cleaning and factor
    level definitions. Packages 'tidyverse' and 'assertr'
    are used for reading and cleaning data.
